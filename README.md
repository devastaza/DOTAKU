# About
DOTAKU is a versatile application that allows you to watch or read your favorite titles (manga, anime or fanfiction), discover something new for yourself, save, share and much more!

# Preamble
*DOTAKU is under active development. Not all features have been added to the build, some are being written, others are being tested. Any criticism and wishes are accepted!*

Let's go over some features of the application:

- [x] Manga
- [ ] Anime
- [ ] Fanfic

### INTERFACE
![App themes](https://github.com/devastaza/DOTAKU/blob/main/screenshots/themes.gif)
The application inherits the philosophy of *One UI* and *Material You*. Most of the controls are at the bottom of the screen, so you don't have to reach up with your finger! Interface is intuitive, convenient and non-intrusive.

### COMMUNICATION
DOTAKU has lots of integrations with other services like *MAL, MangaDex, etc*.  Reading/browsing history will not be lost!

- [x] Gravatar
- [ ] MAL
- [ ] MangaDex
- [ ] Google
- [ ] VK

- [x] Default folders
- [x] Custom folders
- [ ] Share folders

### OPTIMIZATION
DOTAKU is able to run even on very old devices *(20k points in Antutu Benchmark)* without any lags!  It takes care of the storage of your device and will not take up much space.  The .apk file is only Â±40 MB and the application consumes approximately 150 MB of RAM.

Furthermore, here listed a few more reasons to switch to DOTAKU:
- [x] Offline mode
- [x] Download titles
- [ ] Auto-selection of favorite genres
- [ ] Blacklist of titles and genres
- [ ] Multilingual
- [x] Themes for the application
- [x] Traffic saving mode
- [ ] Statistics
- [ ] Achievements
- [ ] Google OAuth, VK OAuth
- [ ] Extensive settings
- [x] Open source
- [x] NO ADS

Omit the little things, I think this is more than enough!  And once again - the application was created for comfort.  For **your** comfort!
