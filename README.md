# About
DOTAKU is a versatile application that allows you to watch or read your favorite titles (manga, anime or fanfiction), discover something new for yourself, save, share and much more!

# Preamble
*DOTAKU is under active development. Not all features have been added to the build, some are being written, others are being tested. Any criticism and wishes are accepted!*

Let's go over some features of the application:

### ALL IN ONE
DOTAKU will collect all the titles for you in one place.  No more surfing different sites!

### INTERFACE
The application inherits the philosophy of *One UI* and *Material You*. Most of the controls are at the bottom of the screen, so you don't have to reach up with your finger! Interface is intuitive, convenient and non-intrusive.

### COMMUNICATION
DOTAKU has lots of integrations with other services like *MAL, MangaDex, etc*.  Reading/browsing history will not be lost!

### FOLDER SYSTEM
In addition to the default folders like "*Recent*", "*Saved*", etc. you can create unlimited folders, as well as share them with friends!  Would you like to share a collection?  With DOTAKU it will be very easy!

### OPTIMIZATION
DOTAKU is able to run even on very old devices *(20k points in Antutu Benchmark)* without any lags!  It takes care of the storage of your device and will not take up much space.  The .apk file is only Â±40 MB and the application consumes approximately 150 MB of RAM.

Furthermore, here listed a few more reasons to switch to DOTAKU:
 - Offline mode
 - Download titles
 - Auto-selection of favorite genres
 - Blacklist of titles and genres
 - Multilingual
 - Themes for the application
 - Traffic saving mode
 - Statistics
 - Achievements
 - Google OAuth, VK OAuth
 - Extensive settings
 - open source
 - NO ADS

Omit the little things, I think this is more than enough!  And once again - the application was created for comfort.  For **your** comfort!
